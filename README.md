## SvelteKit Static Template

A minimal template for building static sites using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/introduction)
and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs). This template uses the `adapter-static` package to generate static files in the
`build` directory.

### Quick Start

Click the "Use this template" button at the top of the repository to create your own project. For more details, check
[GitHub's guide on template repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

Install the dependencies with `npm i` (or `pnpm i` or `yarn`), then start the development server with `npm run dev` or build the project for
production with `npm run build`.

> [!NOTE]\
> Both the development server and the build process require a `.env` file in the root of the project. Make sure to create this file and
> define any necessary environment variables before running the project.
